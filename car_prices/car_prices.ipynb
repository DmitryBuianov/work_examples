    "Хотя для торговли характерна сезонность, маловероятно, что она оказывает значительное влияние на цену такого дорогого товара, как машина. То, как долго продавался конкретный автомобиль по конкретной цене, было бы полезной информацией - но не ясно, корректно ли это вычислять по дате создания анкеты и дате последней активности пользователя.  \n",
    "Учитывать почтовый индекс владельца анкеты `postal_code` также представляется нерациональным. Хотя цена может отличаться в далёких друг от друга регионах, следует соотнести индексы с более крупной территориальной единицей - например, федеральным округом, - что требует отдельной работы.  \n",

    "Явные пропуски были обнаружены почти в 20% объектов. В первую очередь, отсутствовала информация о том, ремонтировалась машина или нет; меньше пропусков встречалось в технических характеристиках: тип коробки передач, тип топлива и тип кузова. Вполне возможно, что эти подробности отсутствовали в анкетах - люди могли ограничиться маркой и моделью. Действительно, марка автомобиля указана всегда. Однако в ~5,6% объектов имелись пропуски в модели. Стоит уточнить, не возник ли сбой при выгрузке данных.  \n",
    "Мы заменили пропуски в типе коробки передач, топлива и кузова самыми часто встречающимися для данных моделей. Пропуски в моделях и информации о ремонте заменили на `unknown`.  \n",
    "В признаках мощности, месяца регистрации и цены присутствовали неявные пропуски - нулевые значения. Поскольку цена - целевой признак, соответствующие объекты мы удалили, также как объекты с аномально маленькой ценой (всего 3% от выборки). Мощность вычислили как медианную для данной модели автомобиля.  \n",
    "Количество фотографий для всех объектов равно нулю - вероятно, произошла ошибка при формировании или выгрузке данных. Мы исключили этот признак как неинформативный, наряду с датой скачивания анкеты, месяцем регистрации автомобиля, датой создания анкеты и датой последней активности пользователя. Если модель и обнаружила бы здесь связь с ценой, это произошло бы случайно.  \n",
    "Мы исключили почтовый индекс владельца анкеты. Хотя цена может отличаться в далёких друг от друга регионах, следует соотнести индексы с более крупной территориальной единицей. В дальнейшем можно проделать такую работу.  \n",
    "В признаках мощности, года регистрации и цены автомобиля найдены аномальные значения. Поскольку подобных объектов сильно меньше 1%, мы просто отбросили их. Для мощности мы взяли границу (среднее +- 2 стандартных отклонения); для года - с 1970 по 2016 (год создания большинства анкет); для цены - меньше (среднего - стандартное отклонение).  \n",
    "Мы отделили целевой признак `price` и разбили данные на обучающую, валидационную и тестовую выборки в соотношении 3:1:1 соответственно. Затем преобразовали категориальные признаки порядковым кодированием, чтобы использовать их для обучения моделей градиентного бустинга и случайного леса"

Однако даже модель пропущена в ~5,6% случаев. Стоит уточнить, не возник ли сбой при выгрузке данных\n",
